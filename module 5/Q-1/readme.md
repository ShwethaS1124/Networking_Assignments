Question -1:
------------

capture and analyze arp ARP packets using wireshark. Inspect the Arp request and reply frames.

Answer:
------

Types of ARP:
------------

"Who has" Packets (ARP Request):
----------------------------------
These are ARP Request packets.When a device wants to know the MAC address corresponding to a specific IP address, it broadcasts a message saying “Who has [IP Address]? Tell [Sender’s IP Address].”
Example from my capture:
Who has 10.11.254.210? Tell 10.128.128.128
This means the device at 10.128.128.128 is asking the network for the MAC address of 10.11.254.210.

"Is at" Packets (ARP Reply):
----------------------------
These are ARP Reply packets.
The device owning the requested IP address responds with its MAC address, saying “[IP Address] is at [MAC Address].”
Example from my capture:
10.11.128.1 is at 7c:5a:1c:cf:f2:a5
This means the device with IP 10.11.128.1 has the MAC address 7c:5a:1c:cf:f2:a5.

ARP Announcement (Gratuitous ARP):
---------------------------------
This is a special type of ARP message where a device announces its own IP and MAC mapping without being asked.
It is often used for IP conflict detection,Updating other devices’ ARP caches,Announcing availability on the network.
Example from my capture:
ARP Announcement for 10.11.254.196
This means a device is broadcasting that it owns the IP address 10.11.254.196 and wants others to update their ARP cache accordingly.
